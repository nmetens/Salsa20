# Salsa20
By: Nick Whiteman and Nathan Metens

In this repo, we explore the Salsa20 stream cypher through the code. We created a codebase that follows closely with the details in D. J. Bernstein's paper on the crypto scheme. There are plenty of tests that show understanding of the code, and notes that we took during our explanation.

We are currently working on breaking the cypher, along with creating a slidedeck to present, and the final paper, all linked below:
