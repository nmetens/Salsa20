# Salsa20
By: Nick Whiteman and Nathan Metens

In this repository, we examine the Salsa20 (and its updated variant, Chacha20) stream cipher using Python code. We created a codebase that closely follows the details in D. J. Bernstein's paper on the cryptographic schemes. Numerous tests demonstrate understanding of the code and the notes we took during our explanation. The program that displays the cipher streams uses a menu with the options to (1) Encrypt, (2) Decrypt, (3) Print Enc/Dec History Logs, (4) View the last encrypted message's xor hash matrix development, and (5) Quit the program.

Below is our project proposal for the Cryptography Course CS 585 at PSU, along with a slide deck that we presented in class, a YouTube video demonstrating the menu, and finally, the research paper we will write that highlights the code and everything we learned along the way:
