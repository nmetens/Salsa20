# Salsa20
By: Nick Whiteman and Nathan Metens

In this repo, we explore the Salsa20 (and it's updated variant Chacha20) stream cypher through the code in Python. We created a codebase that follows closely with the details in D. J. Bernstein's paper on the crypto schemes. There are plenty of tests that show understanding of the code, and notes that we took during our explanation. The program that displays the cipher streams uses a menu with the options to (1) Encrypt (2) Decrypt (3) Print Enc/Dec History Logs (4) View the last encrypted message's xor hash matrix development, and (5) Quit the program.

Below is our project proposal for the Cryptography Course CS 585 at PSU, along with a slidedeck to that we presented in class, aYoutube video demonstrating the menu, and finally, the research paper we will write that highlights the code, and everything we learned along the way:
